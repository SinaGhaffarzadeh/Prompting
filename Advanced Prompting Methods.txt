Here we will learn some advanced prompting techniques including single CoT, Single shot reasoning, PAL, and ReAct.



when we are working with LLMs with Billion Paramiters, perhabs we will not have enough capacity to fine-tune our own model. so, the  only thing we can do 
to use them on our will be the input that we want to inject to it.
on the other word, we need to design a strategy of thinking (A prompting strategy that aid model to return our results).

- one of these strategies is interodeuced by google in 2022. an article that nemed Chain of thought prompting (How model learn to think and make reasoning).
by this technique, we will able to reduce hallicunation of model. in this method, we have to bring up a hypotetical question and how we can reach to its 
answer (step by step), then ask our main question. therefore, the model will answer the question by the exictance pattern in the input prompt. 

- The other artichle in orrder to making prompting strategy is interdeuced by university of tokyo google in 2022 named LLM are zero-shot reasoners.
in this artichle, they interduce a way to to reduece prompting. So, we don't need to tech the model how thinking, just bring up your question and want it
to think step by step.

A: Context
B: Let's think step by step.

- the other arthicle is interduced by CMU, 2022 named PAL: Program-aided language models ==> Generate code as an intermediate reasoning steps.
LLM + Code interpreter

By using python tools (coding), ith will solve our problem or question. To do this, we need to bring up a hypotetical question and like chain of thought
method we give it a solotion by python scripting. 
For example:

hypotetical Q: ...
hypotetical A:
# part of question
tennis_balls= 5
# other part of question
bought_balls = 2 * 3 tennis_balls
# the answer is 
answer = tennis_balls + bought_balls

- the other artichle published for the way of prompting is ReAct. it is combination of chain of thought (CoT) and PAL (using python tools) techniques.

ReAct ==> reason and action ==> 1- reasoning like (CoT)
                                2- using python tools like web searching or database searching

ReAct is like a loop of 3 task ==> thought + action (python tools : wikipedia, website, etc)+ observation.

ReAct process example:
you operate in loop of thought, action, observation. Your available actions are: 1- calculator (expr):
                                                                                    computes an arithmetic expression
                                                                                 2- web search (Query):
                                                                                    Searches the internet
                                                                                 3- Finish (answer):
                                                                                    Provides the final answer
Example of interaction:
Query: what is 135 * 8
Thought: I should use the calculator
Action: calculator (135*8)
observation: 1080
thought: i have the result, i can finish.
action: finish (1080)

Main query: How mush is $125 in EUR?
